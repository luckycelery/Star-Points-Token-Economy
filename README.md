# Star-Points-Token-Economy
This repository is for my SDEV140 final project. The intended purpose of this program
is to serve as an electronic form of a token economy. It should provide children, particularly those with autism,
a fun and engaging way to track their progress toward earning rewards through task
completion. The application allows for personalization per client, helping to maintain
motivation and interest.
